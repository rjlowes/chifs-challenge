    <p>Thank you for taking on Chifs Challenge.</p>
    <p>There is NO entry fee for Chifs Challenge. Instead we ask you to get sponsored. We are passionate about the work Newlife (the charity for disabled children) do and we want to support them as much as possible.</p>
    <p>We have created 3 options to make it as easy as possible for you.</p>
    <ol class="list-numbered">

        <li class="list-numbered__item">You can set up your own separate page linked to Newlife.</li>

    <p><a href="https://help.justgiving.com/hc/en-us/sections/200212391-Raising-money-for-a-charity">Here's a link to Just Giving's instructions on how to set up team pages</a>.

    <h2>The Impact</h2>
    <p>By taking part in Chifs Challenge you are helping to change local children’s lives. Every penny raised will be spent on vital equipment, such as wheelchairs, specialist beds or car seats which children would otherwise go without. This equipment brings freedom, comfort and safety to those in desperate need. Thank you – together we will make life better.</p>

    <p>We would like to introduce you to Chi Fung Tang. (Chif)</p>
    <p>Chif is an enthusiastic and kind hearted person who loves his family and friends, adores
Wycombe Wanderers, is passionate about the royal family and has a heart of gold.</p>
    <p>He lives in Holmer Green and volunteers at three different workplaces every week, including
the Chiltern Food Bank, Work Aid in Chesham, Chiltern Wood recycling and also helps at his
local Church for their Pop-in lunches.</p>
    <p>Chif has been the official 'Team Helper' on five endurance challenges that our group of
friends took on over 8 years. These challenges raised over &pound;120,000 for Newlife, the charity
for disabled children.</p>
    <p>On Chif's 38th birthday, he was asked what he wanted to achieve this year? He responded
with 'I would like to complete a challenge for Newlife'.</p>
    <p>And so, "Chif's Challenge" was born. On Saturday June 9th 2018, Chif will be walking 26.2 miles
from his front door in Holmer Green to Windsor Castle, to raise money for Newlife.</p>
    <p>Chif invites you to take on his marathon too. If you want to challenge yourself to a marathon
walk and join Chif in raising even more money, you can sign up from January 2018. There will
be a shorter challenge for those who would like to participate on the walk into Windsor. </p>
    <p>If you can’t take on your own challenge, Chif would be most grateful if you would show your
support by sponsoring him. Every penny raised will go directly towards local families, children
and babies supported by Newlife. You will be able to sponsor Chif from January 2018.</p>
    <p>Chif has special needs and severe learning difficulties. To us, he is just a very special
individual and part of our "gang".</p>
