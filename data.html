    <h2>The Impact</h2>
    <p>By taking part in Chifs Challenge you are helping to change local children’s lives. Every penny raised will be spent on vital equipment, such as wheelchairs, specialist beds or car seats which children would otherwise go without. This equipment brings freedom, comfort and safety to those in desperate need. Thank you – together we will make life better.</p>

    <p>We would like to introduce you to Chi Fung Tang. (Chif)</p>
    <p>Chif is an enthusiastic and kind hearted person who loves his family and friends, adores
Wycombe Wanderers, is passionate about the royal family and has a heart of gold.</p>
    <p>He lives in Holmer Green and volunteers at three different workplaces every week, including
the Chiltern Food Bank, Work Aid in Chesham, Chiltern Wood recycling and also helps at his
local Church for their Pop-in lunches.</p>
    <p>Chif has been the official 'Team Helper' on five endurance challenges that our group of
friends took on over 8 years. These challenges raised over &pound;120,000 for Newlife, the charity
for disabled children.</p>
    <p>On Chif's 38th birthday, he was asked what he wanted to achieve this year? He responded
with 'I would like to complete a challenge for Newlife'.</p>
    <p>And so, "Chif's Challenge" was born. On Saturday June 9th 2018, Chif will be walking 26.2 miles
from his front door in Holmer Green to Windsor Castle, to raise money for Newlife.</p>
    <p>Chif invites you to take on his marathon too. If you want to challenge yourself to a marathon
walk and join Chif in raising even more money, you can sign up from January 2018. There will
be a shorter challenge for those who would like to participate on the walk into Windsor. </p>
    <p>If you can’t take on your own challenge, Chif would be most grateful if you would show your
support by sponsoring him. Every penny raised will go directly towards local families, children
and babies supported by Newlife. You will be able to sponsor Chif from January 2018.</p>
    <p>Chif has special needs and severe learning difficulties. To us, he is just a very special
individual and part of our "gang".</p>

    <h1>Thank you for taking on Chif’s Challenge!</h1>
    <p>We will be in touch shortly by email and with further updates leading up to the big day.</p>
    <p>The Chif’s Challenge team want this to be a fun and successful experience for everyone so here are 5 Tops Tips to help you get the most out of Chif's Challenge.</p>
</div>
<div class="t-page__main">
    <h2>Our 5 Top Tips</h2>
    <h3>1. Socialise</h3>
    <p>Follow us on <a href="#footer">social media</a> and keep an eye on what's going on.</p>
    <h3>2. Train</h3>
    <p>Get out for a walk.</p>
    <p>Chif’s Challenge will take you on a 26-mile marathon from Holmer Green to Windsor. The route follows footpaths and bridleways as far as Bourne End where you will join the Thames Path for a beautiful stroll alongside the river. The final 2.5 miles will take you down The Long Walk with its fabulous views up to Windsor Castle and the finish.</p>
    <p>26 miles is a tough challenge and you’ll need to put in some training miles ahead of the big day.<!-- – you can follow our training recommendations here. [link – Oli doing]--></p>
    <h3>3. Raise</h3>
    <p>There is NO fee to enter Chif’s Challenge, however, we hope you will ask your very generous family, friends and colleagues to sponsor you via the <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/chifschallenge">Chif’s Challenge JustGiving page</a>. Or, if you prefer, you can set up your own JustGiving page and link it to our fundraising page.</p>
    <p>All money raised will go directly to <a href="http://newlifecharity.co.uk/">Newlife</a> to help disabled and terminally ill children in our local area who need specialist funding.
